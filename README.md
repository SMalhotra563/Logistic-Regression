# Logistic-Regression
 **Logistic regression** is a classification algorithm. It is used to predict a binary outcome based on a set of independent variables. 
 Ok, so what does this mean? A binary outcome is one where there are only two possible scenarios—either the event happens (1) or it does not happen (0).  
 Independent variables are those variables or factors which may influence the outcome (or dependent variable). 

So: Logistic regression is the correct type of analysis to use when we’re working with binary data. 
You know we’re dealing with binary data when the output or dependent variable is dichotomous or categorical in nature; in other words, 
if it fits into one of two categories (such as “yes” or “no”, “pass” or “fail”, and so on).

## However, the independent variables can fall into any of the following categories:##
**Continuous**—such as temperature in degrees Celsius or weight in grams. In technical terms, continuous data is categorized as either interval data, 
where the intervals between each value are equally split, or ratio data, where the intervals are equally split and there is a true or meaningful “zero”. 
For example, temperature in degrees Celsius would be classified as interval data; the difference between 10 and 11 degrees C is equal to the difference between 30 and 31 degrees C, 
but there is no true zero—a temperature of zero degrees does not mean there is “no temperature”. On the other hand, weight in grams would be classified as ratio data; 
it has the equal intervals and a true zero. In other words, if something weighs zero grams, it truly weighs nothing.
**Discrete** 
 ordinal—that is, data which can be placed into some kind of order on a scale. For example, if you are asked to state how happy you are on a scale of 1-5, 
the points on the scale represent ordinal data. A score of 1 indicates a lower degree of happiness than a score of 5, 
but there is no way of determining the numerical value between each of the points on the scale. Ordinal data is the kind of data you might get from a 
customer satisfaction survey.
**Discrete** 
 nominal—that is, data which fits into named groups which do not represent any kind of order or scale. For example, eye color may fit into the categories “blue”, “brown”, or “green”, 
 but there is no hierarchy to these categories.
So, in order to determine if logistic regression is the correct type of analysis to use, ask yourself the following:

 **Is the dependent variable dichotomous?** 
  In other words, does it fit into one of two set categories? Remember: The dependent variable is the outcome; the thing that you’re measuring or predicting.
 **Are the independent variables either interval, ratio, or ordinal?** 
  See the examples above for a reminder of what these terms mean. Remember: The independent variables are those which may impact, or be used to predict, the outcome.
